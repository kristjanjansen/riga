# What we gonna be talking about?

Let's follow up on Ruben's talk:

* What does decoupled / headless Drupal building mean **in practice**?
* How should I **start learning modern frontend** tools?
* When to use decoupled Drupal?

---

# Let's get started 

Three ways to get the data out of Drupal (and into Drupal) using APIs:

---
### REST API

In core

Needs configuration

You have to invent<br>your own standard
--

### JSON API

Soon in core (8.5 / 8.6)

No config, works out of box

Based on<br>industry standard

Good tooling available

--

### GraphQL

Someday in core

Some config needed

By Facebook,<br>now a industry standard

Good tooling available

Drupal module just getting stabile
---

# JSON API

Lets get started

```
composer require drupal/jsonapi
drupal module:install jsonapi
```

---

# Demo time

https://github.com/kristjanjansen/drupal_example

---

# Takeaways from demo

* JSON API data needs extra processing to be usable, for example `jsonapi-parse` in NPM
* You will have to create your own `format_*` functions
* Not all content on page can be included on a single request

---

# Getting all the data for the page

```
const uuid = '95a0a7b9-1d7e-4766-a412-fdf4da2099ba'

// 1. Get the article

axios.get('node/article/' + uuid)
  .then( /* do something with article data */ )

// 2. Get its comments

axios.get('comment/comment'), { params: { 'filter[entity_id.uuid]âŒˆvalueâŒ‰': uuid } })
  .then( /* do something with comments data */ )

// 3. Get logged in user...
// 4. Get related articles...

```

---

# Lets start with frameworks

As the time of writing...

## Javascript

```


export default title => `
  <header>
    <a href="/">
      <h1>${ title }</h1>
    </a>
  </header>
`
```
--

## Vue

```


export default {
  template: `
    <header>
      <a href="/">
        <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
      </a>
    </header>
  `,
  props: ['title']
}
```

--

## React

```
import React from 'react'

export default ({ title }) =>
    <header>
        <a href="/">
            <h1>{ title }</h1>
        </a>
    </header>
```

# Use React in your Drupal theme

1. Install NodeJS https://nodejs.org
2. Add the following three files to Drupal root
3. Run
   
```
npm install
npm run build
```

---

```
// webpack.config.js

module.exports = options => {
  return {
    entry: './themes/custom/example_react/src/main.js',
    output: {
      path: require('path')
        .resolve(__dirname, './sites/default/files/dist'),
        filename: 'build.js'
    },
    module: {
      rules: [{
        test: /.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: [{
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: { cacheDirectory: true },
        }],
      }],
    },
  }
}
```

# Takeaway from the framework demos

* The frameworks are more similar than we think
* For experimentation you do not need framework at all
* *Learn modern Javascript first*. It will be here for a long time

> # When to use decoupled Drupal?

> What will we lose? What will we win?

---

### What we lose<br>in theming
 
* Helper functions for data rendering
* Accessibility markup
* Search engine optimization
* Localization
* RDF ðŸ¤“

--

### What we lose<br>in development

* Authentication and authorization
* Form building and validation
* Testing

--

### What we lose<br>in admin

* In-place editing
* Contextual links
* Toolbar
* Layout management
* Settings tray
* Content preview (soon Workspaces)

---

# What we will win?

We never exposed the true power of modern frontend frameworks, they are not just template engines.

--

<br>

* State management 
* Reactivity
* Realtime data
* Complex animation
* Data visualization

--

<br>

* Server rendering
* Offline apps
* Rendering to other platforms: native apps, VR etc

# What we will win?

Perhaps the biggest gains are not technical nor fancy

---
<br>
> # Freedom

---

# More choices to set up your products and teams

* Developing backend and frontend in different speeds
* Allows more experimentation on technologies, attract talent
* Hiring developers without forcing Drupal on them
